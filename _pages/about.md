While her first MSc was in Linguistics, during her internship in Edinburgh Alessandra had the crazy idea to write a dissertation that connected Automatic Speech Recognition and Natural Language Understanding, because she found it interesting. Naturally this required a tremendous amount of learning, but she had so much fun, she went back to Edinburgh to do a MSc in Speech and Language Processing. Apparently she still hasnâ€™t had enough of research, because after one year in the industry in dialogue development, she left her job to pursue a PhD in Computer Science; and she plans to have a whale of a time playing with dialogues and conversational agents.
